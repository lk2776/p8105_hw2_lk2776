## problem1:

The cleaned NYC dataset contains line, station_name, station_latitude,
station_longitude, routes1-11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada
variables. The cleaning process involved reading the data with missing
value using na(), cleaning the column names using
janitor::clean_names(), selecting the desired columns using select(),
and converting entry variable using mutate() and ifelse() functions. The
resulting dataset has 19 columns and 1868 rows. The data is not tidy
because routes1-11 can be put together in two columns: route_name and
route_value.

- 465 distinct stations in the dataset.

- 468 stations are ada compliant.

- ~38% of stations with vending allow entrance.

- 91 distinct stations serve the A train after data is reformatted so
  that route number and name are distinct variables.

- of the 91 distinct stations that serve the A train, only 34 stations
  are ADA compliant.
